#  [The *mei-friend* Web Application: Editing MEI in the Browser](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at)

*mei-friend* is a ‘last mile’ editor for [MEI music encodings](https://music-encoding.org) intended to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings generated via optical music recognition, or via conversion from other formats, originally implemented as a [plugin package for the Atom text editor](https://atom.io/packages/mei-friend). The [*mei-friend* Web Application](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is a reworking of the tool as a full-featured, cross-browser compatible Web application, with optimised performance and an extended set of features. The application is available online at https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at.

## Components
We use [CodeMirror 5](https://codemirror.net/5/) as our text editor, and [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org) as our music engraving engine. [GitHub](https://github.org) integration is provided using [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) and the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). XML-DOM manipulations are performed using [tXml](https://github.com/TobiasNickel/tXml) by Tobias Nickel. The MEI validation and RNG loading code is adapted from the implementation in the [Verovio editor](https://editor.verovio.org), kindly contributed by Laurent Pugin. It makes use of [libxml2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/). Lute tablature formats are converted to MEI using [luteconv](https://bitbucket.org/bayleaf/luteconv/) by Paul Overell, via the [luteconv-webui](https://codeberg.org/mdwRepository/luteconv-webui) wrapper service developed by Stefan Szepe and [hosted at mdw](https://luteconv.mdw.ac.at). PDF functionalities are provided by [PDFKit](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit) by Devon Govett, using [SVG-to-PDFKit](https://github.com/alafr/SVG-to-PDFKit). MIDI playback is implemented using [html-midi-player](https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player). This is itself powered by [Magenta.js](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-js/tree/master/music/), which also provides the [SGM_Plus sound font](https://storage.googleapis.com/magentadata/js/soundfonts/sgm_plus/soundfont.json) used to sonify your encoding. Icons are taken from GitHub's [Octicons repository](https://github.com/primer/octicons).

## Features

**Editor**. The CodeMirror editor implements important coding conveniences including code folding, line numbering, tag- and bracket matching and auto-closing; as well as alternate key mappings (e.g., ‘vim’, ‘emacs’). MEI-schema-informed autocomplete is also available.

**File input and output**. Files may be opened from the local file system (via a menu option or using drag’n’drop); from the Web via URL; or from GitHub, by specifying a user/organisation and selecting from the available repositories. GitHub integration allows users to log in, fork repositories, view logs, and commit changes; to automatically branch the codebase and open a Pull Request where changes would otherwise lead to merge conflicts (e.g., where multiple users are concurrently editing the same file); and to trigger GitHub Actions where these are available. All Verovio-supported encoding formats are supported (MEI, uncompressed and compressed MusicXML, Humdrum, ABC, PAE). Additional lute-specific encoding formats are supported via the integrated [luteconv Web-service](https://luteconv.mdw.ac.at). The current encoding can be downloaded as MEI, MIDI, and SVG. All interactions occur locally in the browser; nothing is uploaded anywhere, excepting GitHub commits. Editor content is persisted in local storage through page refreshes and browser restarts; support for persisting multiple files simultaneously is envisioned for future development.

**Public repertoire**. Our codebase includes a CSV file recording publicly licensed music encodings, which are offered through the ‘fork repository’ and ‘open URL’ interfaces, alongside a dedicated ‘public repertoire’ access point. Proposed additions to this repertoire meeting our requirements (publicly licensed files; available via GitHub or hosted on a CORS-enabled Web server) are gladly accepted via Github Issue or Pull Request.

**Configurable display**. Many aspects of the tool’s interface are user-configurable, including the orientation and size of the notation and editor panes; their scale factor / font-size; and colouring, via a selection of preconfigured themes, with the option of having the notation match the editor theme (or remain black on white); and, optionally setting the interface to follow the local system’s bright / dark mode settings. Crucially, Eulise’s circadian rhythm adjusts accordingly. These configurations are done via a dedicated ‘settings’ menu, which also exposes a large collection of tool-specific options for CodeMirror and Verovio.

**Navigation**. The interface supports musically meaningful navigation according to encoded sections, pages (first, prev, next, last, specified page number), and within displayed notes/rests. Due to the tightly coupled interaction between encoding (MEI text) and engraving (SVG image), selection and navigation occurs seamlessly across both modalities.

**Pedagogy**. To smooth the learning curve of users new to MEI, the MEI Guidelines are linked to from the ‘Help’ menu; further, users are able to directly look up documentation for the currently selected element through a keyboard shortcut / help menu item.

**Editor functions**. In addition to all features of the Atom plugin package, we now offer commands to insert and delete clefs, beam-spans, and spiccato articulation; to insert the vertical group (vgrp) attribute for selected elements supporting this attribute (such as dynam, dir, hairpin), with dynamic number attribution; and, to insert the supplied element around a selection and show all supplied elements in a configurable colour.

**Validation against MEI schema**. Based on the code of the Verovio editor kindly provided by Laurent Pugin, mei-friend automatically loads the RNG schema specified in the MEI file to validate the encoding. It makes use of Gnome’s libxml2. Validation behaviour is configurable (automatic or on-demand) through the mei-friend settings.

**Facsimile support**. mei-friend makes the content of the facsimile element accessible by displaying zone elements ontop of the surface images in a dedicated facsimile panel, providing interactive zone editing functionality (resizing, panning, inserting & deleting zones) as well as an automated workflow for ingesting external facsimile content into MEI encodings.

**Annotation support**. The annotation panel provides tooling for generating in-line <annot> elements, as well as for listing, navigating between, and visualising annotations. Support for stand-off Web Annotations and for musical objects as specified by the Music Annotation Ontology is also provided.
